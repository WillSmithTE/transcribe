play was excavated between 1962 and 1972 archaeologist that excavated it Dr Charlesworth are and his assistant George Christman for California archaeology at is Jay-Z from UCLA to work on it off and on unfortunately I never wrote it out I never got a like if he was a very busy archaeologist had an active career so fortunately the artifacts were preserved and the collection Pokemon a was kept intact and then it was donated to the Verde Valley archaeology Center one of the spectacular things the result of analyzing and materials are the plant Romaine haven't worked in the top left before the year's most of the plan remains that I've been involved with are you think that you can barely benefind have to bring specialist in to determine even what it is but the point remains that we have to decide are so well-preserved that sometimes I joke my
but I just went down to the supermarket and picked it up for the show because they look like they could have been actually you know in your kitchen for a few days there were a lot of wild plant products that they are very abundant Canon warranty Card application fee for Indian tea or Mormon tea and even Wild Grape SAO season RAV4 archaeologist can activate them for actually living pretty well in the Verde Valley we also have a lot of agave that was roasted most of the bases with you would have been part of the heart which is a very important part of the story to Native American diet today and then also banana get our food and throw their fruits that look like little mini bananas that grow all over at Arizona also where you can apparently are very tasty as well and we had this is even from them indicated that they were collecting them right out the plan and then taking them back home and then roasting if it's like today
to be a God and what I think is really remarkable we actually have three of us with her flowers on them self this is just hard to believe that we would find flowers that preserve some of you that were boy scouts or girl scouts remember making a fire scene anyway and here we have the two tool kit for making fires and you can see that summer well used in Hummer not to love you too clearly fire would have been important and I didn't have a Bic lighter so they had to create they're at their own fires and when I did some research on fire making I was surprised to find that some Native Americans were so good at lighting fires that could light a fire in 2 minutes with anger and get a fire going and then was really remarkable where the read arrows and what's really interesting cuz I did a study of Iberostar is that no two are alike each one is unique which is confusing to me because when you read the letter should I say that well we think American Indian painted Arrow so they know
who is Errol belong to who so if that's the case why do we have 40 something year olds they're all entirely different than and it said some of my informants tell me no no no we know which arrow it is we don't have to paint it to tell those are all important because it several people are hunting they want to know who actually shot to do something to her identity and we are also still has it one of his feathers on it and it's a great horned owl feathers again to have this kind of preservation is pretty unusual or Central Arizona and you can see here where there's two new with the ligaments, probably a deer was used to attach the feather and then tie the upper part which is nothing would have text you here in this would have been one of your three blessings that would have once been present on his head and my big surprise for me when I study the forecast the arrows or composite are also the shaft is made of read with insecure with probably pit and also occasionally with Cena rapping and
I was thin little TN to put your stone projectile point
